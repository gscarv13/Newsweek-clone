# Newsweek-clone

> HTML & CSS 2.0 - Project 3: Using Bootstrap

![screenshot](./assets/img/screenshot-home-page.png)

 The project was designed as a repilca of the [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/) online Newspaper page. 
 The purpose is to capture as much as possible every segment of the page to look exactly like the original.
 A repository was created with two branches (master and branch- Newsweek-clone). 
 The idea was to develop the project in it's entirety within the branch while adopting paired programming practice all through.

 

# Technologies used.

 The project was designed entirely using HTML and CSS.
 The page was created and made responsive to various display sizes using "mobile first" approach with two break points, 768px (medium) and 992px (large).

 As much as possible, boostrap was used extensively to implement the various breakpoints and styling of the page.
 The project also reflected various positioning styles, flex and grid elements.

 The live version of the project can be seen at:
